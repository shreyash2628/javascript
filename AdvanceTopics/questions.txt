1.What are closures in JS?
ANS-> function along with its lexical scope bundled together is closures,in other words function along with the reference to its outer environment.

//deep explanation 
each and every function has access to its outer lexical environment,so when the function is exeecuted in some other scope,it still remembers its outer 
lexical environment,where it was originally present in the code
